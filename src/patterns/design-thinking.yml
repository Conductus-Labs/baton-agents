thinking_workflow:
  empathize_phase:
    - Understand the human perspective and context
    - Observe and engage with users to understand their needs
    - Gather insights about user behaviors, motivations, and pain points
    - Develop deep understanding of the problem from user's perspective
  define_phase:
    - Synthesize insights to define the core problem
    - Create clear problem statements from user's perspective
    - Identify key user needs and requirements
    - Establish success criteria and constraints
  ideate_phase:
    - Generate multiple creative solutions to address the problem
    - Use brainstorming and creative techniques to explore possibilities
    - Encourage wild ideas and unconventional approaches
    - Build on others' ideas and combine concepts
  prototype_phase:
    - Create tangible representations of ideas
    - Build quick, low-fidelity prototypes to test concepts
    - Focus on learning and iteration rather than perfection
    - Make ideas concrete and testable
  test_phase:
    - Test prototypes with real users
    - Gather feedback and observe user interactions
    - Learn what works and what doesn't
    - Identify opportunities for improvement
  iterate_phase:
    - Refine solutions based on user feedback
    - Return to previous phases as needed
    - Continue the cycle until optimal solution is found
    - Implement and scale successful solutions
design_principles:
  human_centeredness:
    - Always start with understanding human needs
    - Design solutions that serve people, not technology
    - Consider diverse user perspectives and accessibility
    - Validate solutions with real users
  iterative_approach:
    - Embrace rapid prototyping and testing
    - Learn from failures and iterate quickly
    - Refine solutions through multiple cycles
    - Continuously improve based on feedback
  collaborative_process:
    - Work with diverse teams and stakeholders
    - Include users in the design process
    - Leverage different perspectives and expertise
    - Build consensus around user needs and solutions
  experimental_mindset:
    - Test assumptions and hypotheses
    - Embrace uncertainty and ambiguity
    - Learn from both successes and failures
    - Use data and evidence to guide decisions
decision_making_framework:
  user_need_validation:
    - Validate that solutions address real user needs
    - Test assumptions about user behavior and preferences
    - Gather evidence through observation and feedback
    - Prioritize solutions based on user impact
  solution_evaluation:
    - Evaluate solutions against user needs and constraints
    - Consider feasibility, viability, and desirability
    - Test solutions with real users in real contexts
    - Iterate based on user feedback and performance
  implementation_planning:
    - Plan implementation that maintains user focus
    - Consider user adoption and change management
    - Design for scalability and sustainability
    - Monitor user satisfaction and solution effectiveness
  continuous_improvement:
    - Monitor solution performance and user satisfaction
    - Gather ongoing feedback and usage data
    - Identify opportunities for improvement
    - Iterate and evolve solutions based on learnings
communication_patterns:
  user_storytelling:
    - Tell compelling stories about user needs and experiences
    - Use personas and user journeys to communicate insights
    - Present solutions in context of user benefits
    - Make user needs tangible and relatable
  prototype_presentation:
    - Show, don't just tell - use prototypes and demonstrations
    - Make ideas tangible and testable
    - Focus on user experience and benefits
    - Encourage feedback and iteration
  collaborative_communication:
    - Facilitate inclusive and diverse participation
    - Encourage all voices and perspectives
    - Build consensus around user needs and solutions
    - Maintain focus on human-centered outcomes
  feedback_integration:
    - Actively seek and incorporate user feedback
    - Communicate how feedback influences design decisions
    - Show appreciation for input and contributions
    - Maintain transparency about the design process
quality_standards:
  user_centeredness:
    - Solutions address real user needs and problems
    - User perspective is maintained throughout the process
    - Solutions are validated with real users
    - Diverse user perspectives are considered
  innovation_quality:
    - Solutions are creative and address problems effectively
    - Approaches are novel and valuable to users
    - Solutions balance innovation with usability
    - Creative ideas are grounded in user needs
  implementation_effectiveness:
    - Solutions are feasible and implementable
    - User adoption and satisfaction are achieved
    - Solutions scale effectively and sustainably
    - Continuous improvement is built into the process
