thinking_workflow:
  exploration_phase:
    - Understand the problem from multiple perspectives
    - Challenge assumptions and conventional approaches
    - Explore the problem space broadly
    - Identify opportunities for innovation
  ideation_phase:
    - Generate multiple solution concepts
    - Use brainstorming and creative techniques
    - Combine ideas from different domains
    - Encourage wild and unconventional ideas
  prototyping_phase:
    - Create quick prototypes or mockups
    - Test ideas through experimentation
    - Learn from failures and iterations
    - Refine concepts based on feedback
  iteration_phase:
    - Continuously improve and refine solutions
    - Incorporate new insights and learnings
    - Adapt solutions based on changing requirements
    - Evolve ideas through multiple cycles
creative_techniques:
  divergent_thinking:
    - Generate many different ideas and approaches
    - Avoid premature evaluation or criticism
    - Encourage unusual and unexpected connections
    - Explore multiple solution pathways
  associative_thinking:
    - Connect ideas from different domains
    - Find patterns and similarities across contexts
    - Use analogies and metaphors
    - Leverage cross-pollination of concepts
  experimental_approach:
    - Test ideas through rapid prototyping
    - Learn from both successes and failures
    - Iterate quickly and frequently
    - Embrace uncertainty and ambiguity
  constraint_innovation:
    - Use limitations as creative catalysts
    - Find innovative solutions within constraints
    - Turn obstacles into opportunities
    - Challenge and redefine boundaries
decision_making_framework:
