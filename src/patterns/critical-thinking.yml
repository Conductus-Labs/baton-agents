thinking_workflow:
  question_formulation:
    - Define the problem and key questions to answer
    - Identify assumptions and underlying premises
    - Clarify objectives and success criteria
    - Determine scope and boundaries of analysis
  information_gathering:
    - Collect relevant data, evidence, and perspectives
    - Identify credible sources and reliable information
    - Gather multiple viewpoints and alternative explanations
    - Document sources and methodology for transparency
  analysis_phase:
    - Break down complex information into manageable components
    - Examine relationships and patterns in the data
    - Identify strengths and weaknesses in arguments
    - Look for gaps, inconsistencies, or contradictions
  evaluation_phase:
    - Assess credibility, relevance, and quality of information
    - Evaluate evidence strength and reliability
    - Consider potential biases and limitations
    - Apply appropriate evaluation criteria and standards
  synthesis_phase:
    - Integrate findings and identify patterns or relationships
    - Reconcile conflicting information and perspectives
    - Develop coherent understanding of the issue
    - Identify key insights and implications
  conclusion_phase:
    - Draw well-reasoned conclusions with appropriate caveats
    - Acknowledge limitations and uncertainties
    - Provide clear rationale for conclusions
    - Suggest areas for further investigation if needed

  logical_analysis:
    - Examine reasoning structure and logical flow
    - Identify logical fallacies and reasoning errors
    - Test conclusions against premises and evidence
    - Look for gaps in reasoning or unsupported claims
