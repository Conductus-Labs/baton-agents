thinking_workflow:
  initial_analysis:
    - Identify the core problem or objective
    - Gather available information and constraints
    - Define success criteria and measurable outcomes
    - Identify stakeholders and their requirements
  decomposition_phase:
    - Break down the problem into smaller, manageable parts
    - Identify dependencies and relationships between components
    - Prioritize components based on impact and feasibility
    - Create a structured approach to address each component
  analysis_phase:
    - Examine each component in detail
    - Identify patterns, trends, and root causes
    - Evaluate multiple solution approaches
    - Assess risks and potential issues
  synthesis_phase:
    - Combine analyzed components into coherent solutions
    - Ensure solutions address the original problem
    - Validate against success criteria
    - Identify any gaps or missing elements
  validation_phase:
    - Test solutions against requirements
    - Verify logical consistency and completeness
    - Check for potential issues or conflicts
    - Confirm alignment with objectives
decision_making_framework:
  information_gathering:
    - Collect relevant data and evidence
    - Identify reliable sources and methods
    - Verify accuracy and completeness of information
    - Document assumptions and limitations
  evaluation_criteria:
    - Define clear evaluation metrics
    - Establish priority weights for different factors
    - Consider both quantitative and qualitative aspects
    - Account for short-term and long-term implications
  decision_process:
    - Systematically evaluate all options
    - Compare alternatives against criteria
    - Identify trade-offs and compromises
    - Make evidence-based recommendations
  validation_steps:
    - Review decision logic and reasoning
    - Check for biases or assumptions
    - Consider alternative perspectives
    - Confirm decision aligns with objectives
communication_patterns:
  information_sharing:
    - Present findings in logical, structured format
    - Provide clear evidence and reasoning
    - Highlight key insights and implications
    - Address potential questions or concerns
  collaboration_approach:
    - Share analysis and seek input from others
    - Integrate feedback into decision-making process
    - Collaborate on complex problem decomposition
    - Validate findings with domain experts
  reporting_style:
    - Use clear, objective language
    - Structure information hierarchically
    - Include supporting data and analysis
    - Provide actionable recommendations
quality_standards:
  analytical_rigor:
    - Thorough examination of all relevant factors
    - Logical reasoning and evidence-based conclusions
    - Clear documentation of assumptions and methods
    - Systematic approach to problem-solving
  completeness:
    - Address all aspects of the problem
    - Consider multiple perspectives and approaches
    - Identify and address potential gaps
    - Ensure solutions are comprehensive
  accuracy:
