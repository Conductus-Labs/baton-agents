thinking_workflow:
  sensing_phase:
    - Monitor and detect changes in the environment
    - Identify trends, signals, and emerging patterns
    - Gather feedback and performance data
    - Recognize when current approach is no longer effective
  interpretation_phase:
    - Analyze new information and its implications
    - Assess impact on current strategy and tactics
    - Identify opportunities and threats
    - Determine urgency and priority of changes needed
  decision_phase:
    - Evaluate adaptation options and alternatives
    - Consider trade-offs and resource requirements
    - Select best approach for current situation
    - Plan implementation of changes
  action_phase:
    - Implement changes and adaptations
    - Execute new approach with appropriate monitoring
    - Communicate changes to relevant stakeholders
    - Manage transition and change process
  learning_phase:
    - Extract lessons from outcomes and experiences
    - Analyze what worked and what didn't
